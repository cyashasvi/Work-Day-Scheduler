# Work-Day-Scheduler
The goal of this project was to build a work day scheduler that would be able to 
react to the time and date, and change colors accordingly. Additionally, regardless of refreshing the page, the browswer would still be able to store the information and show it on the page as well, where the information was written for each time slot. 
1. create function to show the time
2. create function to save the data
3. create function to change the colors

I struggled through most of it, and I have the building blocks for each of the last two functions.
